            <p className="mx-2">I am a husband and father first.  My loyalty and passion are first given to my family.  Although, sports and outside activities are very close. I love the New England region of the United States.</p>
            <p className="mx-2">I have been in web development for five months now.  I have become a full stack web developer through my time in the Butler Web Development Bootcamp.  I can assist teams on both the front and back ends to accomplish their web goals. The reason I enjoy Programming is because I enjoy riddles and puzzles.  Programming to me is one endless puzzle that I continously get to enjoy.  I am excited for the future and to continue learning in this great field.
